Hi, there.
I start plan a small process about free knowledge for low income people,improve their background.

IF YOU INTERESTING JION US ,LOOK MORE BELOW PLEASE.
 
KEYNECK
means: The key open door which trap you neck.

My logic is contribute a digital building , includ some module,for example: socail section,community activity section,teaching knowledge section.
But there is a problem,how to attack those low income people jion this progarm?
Another problem is how make attention to companies found protein employees from here ?

I use my own expriences reference solution by this
Fristly:
attack : social activities
         perfessors class
         entrianments about success human
         background affact events
         
Secondly:
employment: diploma quality
            activities organiztion achievement
            competition activities
            temproary period
            interview test online graduates
            introduce letter from teachers and grounps
If this market operation success, more and more people will be helped at their career.
I had thinking input free login in fee ,and make sure this prograss have enought investiment apply it gose on.

For example: donate by graduates (as Havrard Business School ,Standford university, Oxford university ,MIT )
             adversting (exterior commercial companies)
             
Now.
we need a base model on website,put those section on it,and test it .
I love to run this prograss,and sure it will make a big successful .Because nowaday,low income people are so much more lose their job or living low income .
i hope people who read this ,may be give some advices ,how to begin the website.and thank you .
